# Arithmetic Progressions
If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘d’ is the common difference
- nth term of an AP = a + (n-1)*d.
- Arithmetic Mean = Sum of all terms in the AP / Number of terms in the AP.
- Sum of ‘n’ terms of an AP = 0.5 n (first term + last term) = 0.5 n [ 2a + (n-1) d ].

# Geometric Progressions

If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘r’ is the common ratio
- nth term of a GP = a*r^(n-1).
- Geometric Mean = nth root of product of n terms in the GP.
- Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r < 1) = [a*(1 – r^n)] / [1 – r].
- Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r > 1) = [a*(r^n – 1)] / [r – 1].
- Sum of infinite terms of a GP (r < 1) = (a) / (1 – r).

# Quadratic Equation

A quadratic equation is a second-order polynomial equation of a variable say x. The general form of a quadratic equation is given as:

a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0

Where a,b and c are real known values and,
a can't be zero.

A quadratic equation has two roots. The roots of a quadratic equation can be easily obtained using the quadratic formula:
roots = (-b ± √(b2 - 4ac))/2a

There arises three cases as described below while finding the roots of a quadratic equation:
- If b2 < 4ac, then roots are complex
(not real).
For example roots of x2 + x + 1, roots are
-0.5 + i1.73205 and -0.5 - i1.73205

- If b2 = 4ac, then roots are real
and both roots are same.
For example, roots of x2 - 2x + 1 are 1 and 1

- If b2 > 4ac, then roots are real
and different.
For example, roots of x2 - 7x - 12 are 3 and 4
