# Arithmetic Progressions
If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘d’ is the common difference
- nth term of an AP = a + (n-1)*d.
- Arithmetic Mean = Sum of all terms in the AP / Number of terms in the AP.
- Sum of ‘n’ terms of an AP = 0.5 n (first term + last term) = 0.5 n [ 2a + (n-1) d ].

# Geometric Progressions

If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘r’ is the common ratio
- nth term of a GP = a*r^(n-1).
- Geometric Mean = nth root of product of n terms in the GP.
- Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r < 1) = [a*(1 – r^n)] / [1 – r].
- Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r > 1) = [a*(r^n – 1)] / [r – 1].
- Sum of infinite terms of a GP (r < 1) = (a) / (1 – r).
